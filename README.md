## Current limitations

- Board calibration is still a bit manual.  
- We assume a fixed board, well framed in the camera field of view.  

Next steps:
- Run 
- more robust and automatic board detection,  
- more varied demonstrations and scenarios,  
- better collision handling and grasping of different tokens.
